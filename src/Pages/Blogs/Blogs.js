                        NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development.

                        It is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server.

                        It's a JavaScript interpreter and environment with some valuable libraries that JavaScript programming can use separately.

                        Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly abbreviated as JS. It can be said that Javascript is the updated version of the ECMA script. Javascript is a high-level programming language that uses the concept of Oops but it is based on prototype inheritance.

                        It is an open-source, cross-platform, interpreted, lightweight scripting programming language that is used to develop dynamic and web applications.

                        It is a programming language. It works in any browser that has a proper browser engine.

                        <h2>mongodb </h2>
                        NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.

                        MongoDB is the most popular of the new breed of non-relational NoSQL databases. Specifically, it's a document database, also called a document-oriented database or a document store.

                        Document structures usually align with objects that developers are working with in code, which is a more flexible approach than the row-and-column table-oriented structure of a relational database. Developers can rework document (data) structures as their application requirements change over time. With this approach, data structures become like code â€” both are under developers' control.

                        <h2>Node js:</h2>
                        Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript..

                        Microservices-based architecture lets you split your application into small units. Each part can independently deploy and scale; it does not matter if different programming languages and teams write it. You can also test the small units individually.

                        is the greatest tool for building real-time web applications. It provides cross-platform applications which run easily on any web. So you basically don't need anything extra for running up a node application. You only need for making one.

                        <h2>purpose of jwt</h2>
                        JSON Web Tokens are the new fancy kids around the block when it comes to transporting proofs of identity within an untrusted environment like the Web.

                        A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. It's an encoded, URL-safe string that can contain an unlimited amount of data (unlike a cookie) and is cryptographically signed. When a server receives a JWT, it can guarantee the data it contains can be trusted because it's signed by the source

                    <div>
                        <h2>how does it work</h2>
                        JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

                        A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
