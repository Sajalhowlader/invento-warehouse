                    <p>Warehousing is an important piece of your retail supply chain. While its not the sexiest of subjects, warehousing and inventory storage affect everything from sourcing raw materials and, efficiently managing inventory, to getting orders delivered to customers on time.

                        Though the principles of warehousing have not changed much over the years, warehousing solutions have evolved a lot.
